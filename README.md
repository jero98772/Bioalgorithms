### Features 

this library is for python users but is made in rust because is going to become the new C++/C , is compiled it mean normaly is more faster that interpreter langages like python,javascript and others

it have more over 30 functions used for Bioinformatics and Programers, some of thems are most optized in based theorical infometion like using Dinamic programing, some greddy technics and more, ideal data structures for some problems like hashmap...

you can use this code with rust too

### Installing

**Download repositories**

    git clone https://github.com/jero98772/Bioinformatics-toolspy.git

**Create virtual enviroment:**

    cd Bioinformatics-toolspy
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install maturin

**Compile rust code:**

    maturin develop

**For implement this in your code** 

you have to put temporaly your python file inside the folder  and run 

    python <your file>



### Made for:

this proyect is made to learn some bioinformatics algoriths focused to optimize python with rust and pyo3, and do something better or more popular to [biopython](https://github.com/biopython/biopython) it have some functions in pure python like knn... (and we know python is more slow langue that rust sometimes)


### Notes and Contribution

you are welcome to contribute , if see a problem, do issue. if you wanna use it , and you dont know something write me [jero98772@protonmail.com](jero98772@protonmail.com)

it seems like a good library with a lot of potencial , but i dont know if continue building this beacuse i have other things to do
