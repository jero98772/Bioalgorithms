## Overview
Bioinformatics-toolspy is a powerful library tailored for Python users but built in Rust, harnessing the efficiency and speed of compiled languages. With over 30 functions crafted for both bioinformatics and general programming tasks, this library integrates dynamic programming, greedy techniques, and optimized data structures such as hashmaps.

Beyond Python, Bioinformatics-toolspy offers compatibility with Rust, empowering developers to leverage its capabilities across different programming paradigms.

## Features

- **Efficiency**: Utilizes Rust's compiled nature for enhanced performance compared to interpreted languages like Python and JavaScript.
- **Comprehensive Functionality**: Offers a diverse set of functions optimized for various bioinformatics and programming tasks.
- **Algorithmic Techniques**: Implements advanced algorithms including dynamic programming and greedy strategies.
- **Data Structures**: Leverages efficient data structures such as hashmaps to streamline problem-solving.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Python 3.x
- Rust (for compiling Rust code)
- `maturin` (for Rust bindings)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jero98772/Bioinformatics-toolspy.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment:**
   ```
   cd Bioinformatics-toolspy
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install maturin
   ```

3. **Compile Rust Code:**
   ```
   maturin develop
   ```

4. **Integration with Your Code:**
   Place your Python file temporarily inside the folder and execute:
   ```
   python <your_file>
   ```



## Purpose

Bioinformatics-toolspy is a project aimed at enhancing bioinformatics algorithm implementations, focusing on optimizing Python with Rust and PyO3 bindings. It aims to provide a complement to existing libraries like [Biopython](https://github.com/biopython/biopython), featuring functions both in pure Python and Rust for improved performance.

## Contribution

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue. For inquiries or assistance, contact [jero98772@protonmail.com](mailto:jero98772@protonmail.com).

While the library shows promise, its future development may be uncertain due to other commitments.
